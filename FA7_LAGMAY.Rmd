This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


#FA7

#1 
#A
#probability of memory stick scrapped
#the length interval must be computed first since they are uniformly distributed between 2 and 12

L = 12 - 2 #length interval between minimum and maximum values of memory stick lengths
P(memory stick) = 2/L #equation for finding the probability of a memory stick being scrapped

#B
#use set seed as your random number generator
#n = 50 to generate 50 random values as specified and min = 2 for minimum value and max = 12 for maximum value of the possible value for any of 50 randon numbers generated
#var for finding the variance of stimulated values
#hist as histogram function for stimulated values
#mean for finding the mean of stimulated values

```{r}
